<p>Here is an overview of the challenges I completed.<br/>
  I did follow the videos of The Coding Train, the main difference is that I don't use the P5 framework.
</p>

<h1>Challenges:</h1>
<ul>
	<li><a href="0001_Starfield/index.html" target="_blank">#1: Starfield</a>
			<p>This sure was a challenging one<br>
			Since I don't use P5 I didn't have acces to the map function which took some time to get it right myself.<br>
			In the end I got it all to work except for the stroke but that's something I can live with.</p>
	</li>
  <li><a href="0027_Fireworks/index.html" target="_blank">#27: Fireworks</a>
  		<p>Fun little challenge. Not to many difficulties</p>
  </li>
  <li><a href="0051_A-star_Algorithm/index.html" target="_blank">#51: A* Algorithm</a>
  		<p>The most challenging part was drawing the line correctly.<br>
  		I kept getting a second line that was from 0,0 till the destination. Managed to get rid of it though.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
